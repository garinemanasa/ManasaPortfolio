Hi..Here is short intro about me.,
I'm a passionate Data Analyst who loves turning raw data into meaningful insights. I approach every project like a data detective—curious, detail-focused, and committed to finding patterns that help drive smarter decisions.

My journey into data started in the classroom. As a teacher, I learned how to recognize patterns, explain complex ideas clearly, and connect with people—skills that now shape how I analyze and communicate data. This background helps me see data from multiple angles and turn numbers into stories that matter.

I’ve worked with large, complex datasets—especially in healthcare—to improve patient care and streamline operations. I enjoy solving real-world problems and making data easy to understand and act on.

My Skills Include:

SQL – to extract and explore data

Tableau & Power BI – to build clear, engaging dashboards

Python – for deeper analysis and automation

Power Query – to transform and shape data

PostgreSQL – for managing structured databases

To me, data is more than numbers—it’s a tool for change. I use my technical skills and communication experience to help organizations make better, data-driven decisions.

Let’s work together to turn data into a powerful asset for growth and innovation
